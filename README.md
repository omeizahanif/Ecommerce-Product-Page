## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned more about applying mobile-first principles in designing interfaces.
- I also learned about using functional programming principles in writing maintainable and reusable code.

### Continued development

- I intend to learn design patterns (in order to improve my codebase) and dive head into React (in order to create reusable components and improve performance)

### Useful resources

- [Box Shadow Generator](https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow) - This helped me in creating box shadows with ease for interactive components.
- [Setting CSS Opacity Without Affecting Child Elements](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/faq/css-background-opacity-without-effecting-the-child-elements.php) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to set opacity without affecting child elements. It was useful in designing the lightbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
